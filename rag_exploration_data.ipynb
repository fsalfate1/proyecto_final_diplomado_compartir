      "En 2025, las oportunidades para exportar servicios desde Chile son diversas y abarcan varios sectores. Según el \"Informe de Exportaciones No Cobre No Litio - Noviembre 2025\", los principales servicios exportados incluyen tecnologías de la información y comunicación (TICs), mantenimiento y reparación, administración, servicios financieros, investigación y desarrollo, asesoría, ingeniería, transporte, y servicios logísticos, entre otros. Estos sectores muestran variaciones en sus exportaciones, con TICs liderando con un valor FOB de US$ 909 millones y un crecimiento del 2,7% en comparación con el año anterior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Además, el \"Manual de Exportación de Servicios\" sugiere que los servicios representan una alternativa para diversificar las canastas exportadoras en áreas de alto valor agregado e inserción en cadenas globales de valor. Esto implica que hay un potencial significativo para que las empresas chilenas expandan su oferta de servicios a mercados internacionales, aprovechando la capacidad de prestar servicios de manera remota o a través del desplazamiento temporal de consumidores al país.\n",
      "\n",
      "En términos de mercados, Estados Unidos, Perú, y Colombia son algunos de los principales destinos para los servicios chilenos, con Estados Unidos liderando con un valor FOB de US$ 924 millones y un crecimiento del 10,0%. Esto indica que hay una demanda creciente en estos países para los servicios ofrecidos por Chile, lo que representa una oportunidad para las empresas que buscan expandir su presencia internacional.\n",
      "\n",
      "En resumen, las oportunidades para exportar servicios en 2025 se centran en sectores tecnológicos y de alto valor agregado, con un enfoque en mercados como Estados Unidos y países de América Latina. Las empresas pueden beneficiarse al diversificar su oferta y aprovechar las tendencias de crecimiento en estos sectores y mercados.\n",
